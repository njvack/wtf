  // Manifest file for face rating task
  // This task shows a face with two sliders:
  // * do you remember this person?
  // * do you like this person?
  // You get two floating-point numbers between 0 and 1
  // There are also four "check" images, with text saying where people should
  // set the ratings. For those images, the instrument will record whether
  // people have marked correctly or not.
